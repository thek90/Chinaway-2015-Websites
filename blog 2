The first school that I taught at was the Mianyang Technical Institute. My arrival at the technical school completely shattered many of the expectations I had for the school and its students. Before I arrived I was informed that the city of Mianyang was a rural area and thus expected the school itself to be less technologically advanced. The school itself met all of my expectations for a vocational school in a rural Chinese city but the students did not. I was confronted with the full scale of smartphone proliferation throughout China. Literally every student in my class was equipped with a smartphone. The branding varied from local Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Honor to foreign brands like Samsung, Sony, Apple, and HTC. Smartphones aside I have also learned a lot from teaching the students in the school. Although I was far from the most popular teacher there I felt that I was able to learn a lot about Chinese culture and society and impart some practical knowledge about English and American culture to those children as well. 
The visit to the site of the Sichuan earthquake was a very moving experience. If found the exhibit to be particularly interesting because the entire city was preserved as memorial site. I had originally thought that the exhibit would be an indoor museum, I did not expect to take a tour of the entire city. I found the exhibit to be very fascinating since many of the buildings were partially collapsed and you could see snapshots of peopleâ€™s daily lives through the wreckage like a mattress hanging out of a window or a group of chairs arranged around a dining table. Throughout the city one could see the remnants of everyday buildings like a Suzuki dealership and a basketball court overgrown with grass. Visiting the earthquake site was a very humbling experience and really revealed the insignificance of human existence compared to the ever-changing forces of nature.
