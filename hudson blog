Today was our second day at the Boreshi Buddhist monastery. Yesterday our group merely took a small walk through the grounds of the monastery but today we were able to fully experience a local Buddhist ritual. The ritual began at eight in the morning so we had to leave the hotel at seven thirty. Once we arrived at the monastery we were ushered into the main sanctuary where several statues were flanked by people dressed in Buddhist robes. Once inside we lined up and prostrated ourselves to the statues. Then we were given incense and placed the incense sticks on a pot in front of the statues. Following this we were lead outside where two monks chanted from Buddhist text and we bowed to two drawings depicting various Buddhaâ€™s. Shortly after we returned to the returned to the main sanctuary and sat cross-legged while people chanted from Buddhist text. This went on for over an hour and a half. The dedication and perseverance of the people around us was admirable to say the least. After only sitting for twenty minutes my legs grew numb and by the one-hour mark I was wriggling around on my seat and visibly grimacing while the people around me have hardly moved a muscle. By the time to chanting finally ended I was ready to leap out of my seat and run laps around the building. However, because I had been sitting down so long I almost tripped over my feet instead. After this we went outside again to bow to the drawings and then went for a vegetarian lunch.
