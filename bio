Hello my name is Hudson Shou and I come from Fremont California. I am a tenth grade student who attended American High school. My favorite subjects include WWII history and geopolitics. I am also very interested in computers, video games, and Japanese animation. This summer I stayed in China for five weeks visiting family and attending the China way program. I visit China on an annual basis and this summer I decided to attend this volunteer program to learn more about Chinese culture. When I first joined the program with my friend Nathaniel my expectations were completely different from what I encountered. The things I learned from teaching as well as my students proved to be far more valuable than I initially anticipated. I really felt that my experience teaching the Chinese students has changed me profoundly.
