 	At first glance, the temple appears as any other, complete with stone steps and ambient, religious music. We were shown to our workplace, where we spent about an hour setting up a wireless network. After discussing our schedule for the next few days, we were given a tour of the temple grounds. After walking through a wooded area, we reached an open field, where various crops were grown such as grapes, peanuts, and corn. The setting contained the loud, but pleasant sound of chirping crickets. After proceeding up a hill, we were shown two plants given by two English teachers. These two plants are a sign of friendship. We then turned around and headed back to the temple grounds. Overall, one can say that the setting is quiet, natural, and simple. Although some wish to live in such a place, I tend to find an urban setting more to my liking.
	Dinner consisted of a bowl of plain noodles and various toppings that we added according to preferences. Everything served is vegetarian-friendly. Talking is to be kept at a minimum, and people of the opposite gender are not to sit at the same table. Special gestures are used if one wishes for more food. Everyone is expected to completely finish their meal and assist in cleaning up. Before departing for a hotel, we were served tea. Culturally wise, different things are expected here compared to the States. For example, it is perfectly normal to talk while eating here in America. Also, a large amount of the food here in America is not vegetarian. Although their beliefs are quite different from ours, we all ought to respect and preserve their customs.
