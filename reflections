While at the temple I participated in many activities including chopping weeds and witnessing a Buddhist ceremony. I was able to witness the everyday lives of the monks and pilgrims to the temple and gain a more in-depth understanding of the lifestyle of a follower of Buddhism. Personally I was very impressed by the level of concentration and perseverance demonstrated by the practitioners of Buddhism. The ceremony began with showing respect to the Buddha’s and offering incense. Following this we returned into the main shrine and began to recite the Diamond Sutra(金刚经). The monks read the entire Sutra which took around two hours. The entire time they moved not a muscle while I was squirming and wiggling like a worm. Afterwards I could only feel awe at the intense dedication of the monks to their faith. The next day we went out to the fields behind the monastery to cut grass. The monk told us that instead of removing the roots of the weeds we could simply cu the grass and let the dead grass fertilize the land. Then when the grass grew back out we could cut it again increasing sustainability. It was tiring work but it felt satisfying, working for the food that we ate.
